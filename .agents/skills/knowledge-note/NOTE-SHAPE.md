# Note shape

The skeleton, the checklist, and one worked reordering.

Read this before writing or moving anything. The skeleton below is what you write into, not
what you compare against afterwards.

## The skeleton

```markdown
# <Topic, as a noun phrase>

*<Lesson note for [T<n>](<issue url>). — when a ticket drove the note; drop this sentence
when none did.> <One or two sentences: what this note is for, and any honest warning about
it — that it teaches no mathematics, that it is mechanical, that it is the hardest rung so
far.>*

---

## 1. The goal

*Needs: nothing before it.*

<What exists at the end: the concrete artifact, in the project's own terms — a signature, a
type, a checked property.>

<Why now: what is blocked or expensive without it. What is not missed if the topic is
skipped.>

<What this note does not cover: the boundary.>

<The route: every ## section below, in order, one clause each, and why the order is that
one — which section exists only because the one before it left something unfinished.
Written last, once the section order has stopped moving, and rewritten whenever a section
moves.>

---

## 2. <The baseline concept — how this is normally done>

*Needs: §1.*

<The standard shape, drawn out. Each stage's input and output named. Every term this note
will later use, defined here on first use. Why anyone does it this way.>

<Handoff: what this section leaves unfinished, which is what §3 opens on.>

---

## 3. <Where the difficulty actually is>

*Needs: §2.*

<The specific thing that makes the general problem hard here. Concrete instance first, then
the rule.>

<Handoff: what this section leaves unfinished, which is what §4 opens on.>

---

## 4. <What this project picked, and why>

*Needs: §2, §3.*

<In this fixed order:>
<  1. the problem the choice is about, restated in this note's terms>
<  2. the options in the wild, each neutral, each sourced>
<  3. the choice, stated plainly>
<  4. what it costs, and the invariant that pays for it>
<  5. what it does not buy>
<  6. what it actually buys>

---

## 5. <The mechanism, in full>

*Needs: §4.*

---

## 6. <Worked by hand>

*Needs: §5.*

<Traces. The smallest ones first.>

---

## 7. The Rust shape

*Needs: §5.*

---

## 8. Checking yourself before the quiz

*Needs: everything above.*

---

## Sources

<Every source, with the URL that was actually fetched, the title, and the identifier.>
```

Sections 2 through 7 are named for their content, not for these placeholders. Their *count*
varies; their *order* is the ladder. Sections 1, 8 and Sources are fixed.

Every `##` section carries both edges of its rung: the prerequisite line under the heading
(I5) and the handoff at its end (I6). Only §§2 and 3 show the handoff above, to keep the
skeleton short; every section has one, and the last section hands off to what the note left
undone or to the note that continues it.

## The checklist

Run all of it, then route each failure.

A failed line under **Goal**, **Dependency order**, **Baseline before deviation**, **Decision
sections** or **Preservation** is blocking: fix it. A failed line under **Shape** is a
recommendation: report it and let the author decide. Never respond to a failed line by
summarising or deleting the section it points at.

**Goal**

- [ ] Reading §1 alone tells you what artifact exists at the end, stated as a signature, a
      type, or a checked property.
- [ ] §1 says what is blocked without this topic.
- [ ] §1 says what the note does not cover.
- [ ] §1 gives the route: every `##` section in order, with the reason the order is that one.
- [ ] The route matches the note's actual section order and names no section that is gone.
- [ ] No mechanism appears in §1.

**Dependency order**

- [ ] Every technical term's first *use* comes after its first *definition* — in this note,
      or at a named section of an earlier note.
- [ ] Every `##` section carries a prerequisite line.
- [ ] No prerequisite line points forward.
- [ ] Every `##` section ends by naming what it leaves unfinished, and that is what the next
      section opens on. The last one hands off to what the note left undone, or says plainly
      that nothing follows.
- [ ] No handoff is a summary of the section it closes.
- [ ] No section assumes a term marked "assumed" that the reader of the previous notes would
      not actually have.

**Baseline before deviation**

- [ ] Every "this project does not do that" has a preceding section that taught *that*.
- [ ] No deviation section introduces baseline vocabulary.
- [ ] The baseline section says why anyone does it the standard way, not only what it is.

**Decision sections**

- [ ] Concept and decision are sibling sections, not nested.
- [ ] Options in the wild appear before costs and before non-reasons.
- [ ] Each option is described so a competent person's reason for picking it is visible.
- [ ] The choice's costs are followed by the invariant or rule that pays for them.

**Shape**

- [ ] No heading deeper than `###`.
- [ ] No manual numbering below the second level.
- [ ] Within each section, the concrete instance precedes the general rule — or, where the
      example cannot be read without the rule, the rule is stated first and kept short.

**Preservation**

- [ ] Nothing was deleted. Quotations, traces, caveats and worked examples are all still
      present, whole.
- [ ] No section was replaced by a summary of itself.
- [ ] Material you believe should be cut was reported as a recommendation, not removed.

**`CLAUDE.md` — Sources and citations** *(project-specific — replace this group when using
the skill in another repository)*

- [ ] Every factual claim carries the URL that was actually fetched, plus title and
      identifier.
- [ ] Any source that could not be fetched is reported as unfetched, not cited from memory.
- [ ] Anything worked out rather than read is marked as inferred, in those words.
- [ ] Every path, filename, flag and command carries its `file:line`.
- [ ] The note explains; it does not decide the project's direction.
- [ ] `docs/knowledge/README.md` has the note's row.

## Worked example — what went wrong in note 02

`docs/knowledge/02-parsing-lambda-terms.md` is the case this skill was written from. Its
content is sound and its sources are real. Its order is not.

**As written.** §1 *Why the parser comes this early* → §2 *Where the difficulty actually is*
→ §3 *No lexer, and what replaces it*, whose §3.1 opens:

> The obvious architecture is two passes: a lexer turning `&str` into a `Vec` of tokens, then
> a parser turning that into a `NamedTerm`.

That sentence is the first appearance of *lexer*, *token*, *two passes* and *pass* in the
note, and it is also the sentence that rejects them. Three paragraphs later the note says
"**This project does not do that.**" The baseline was named, quoted at, and discarded, but
never taught. A reader without a compilers background has been handed a decision about a
thing they do not have.

The subsections then run `§3.1` decision → `§3.1.1` the other model → `§3.1.2` costs →
`§3.1.3` non-reasons → `§3.1.4` what it buys. That is four levels deep, and it is the order
of an argument being settled, not of a concept being learned: the costs of the choice arrive
before the reader has seen the alternatives they are being traded against.

**The ladder it should have had.**

| Rung | Section | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The goal — `parse(&str) -> NamedTerm`, so every later note can write test terms as text | — |
| 2 | How text becomes a tree, normally — characters, the lexer and what a token is, the parser and what an AST is, why the split exists at all | 1 |
| 3 | Where the difficulty actually is — the notation conventions, the two rules | 2 |
| 4 | What this project picked: no lexer — problem, then Nystrom / Rocq / Lean as three real options, then the choice, then trivia as its cost and the cursor invariant that pays it, then the TCB non-reason, then reversibility | 2, 3 |
| 5 | The lexical shapes, whitespace, comments, identifiers | 4 |
| 6 | The grammar | 3, 5 |
| 7 | Two parses, done by hand | 6 |
| 8 | Errors, the Rust shape, the self-check | 7 |

Rung 2 does not exist in the note today. It is not a summary of rung 4 — it is the section
whose absence makes rung 4 unreadable, and writing it makes the note longer.

Everything else on that list is already written, sourced and correct. The revision is
one new section and a reordering.

This table is the output format for a written ladder: one row per rung, the section named for
its content, and the rungs it needs.
